# JMAT library

This is a clone of the JMAT Java library ([https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmat/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmat/)). I simply created this repository to add the library as a dependency to my SBT project. If you are looking for high performance matrix libraries for Java, check [Matrix Toolkit for Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.matrix-toolkits-java/mtj).
